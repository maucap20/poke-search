# poke-search

## Description

"Poke-Search" is a website that allows users to search pokemons based of name and pokemon type. By clicking on certain pokemons, the user will be transported into a details page listing out the individual pokemon stats generated from a locally sourced public Pokedex API  (https://pokeapi.co/?ref=public_apis).

The creation of Poke-Search is for several students in the Columbia University Full-Stack Bootcamp to grasp a clear understanding of collaboration while utilizing development skills obtained in the last three weeks.
