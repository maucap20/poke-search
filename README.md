# poke-search

## Description

"Poke-Search" is a website that allows users to search pokemons based off name, while displaying the pokemon's stats and typing. By clicking on certain pokemons, the user will be transported into a details page listing out the individual pokemon stats generated from a locally sourced public Pokedex API  (https://pokeapi.co/?ref=public_apis). Along with this, the user may also search for a Pokemon Trading Card Game card by entering the desired pokemon's name or a key word that connects to the card in the search field for TCG. All information and images for this section are sourced from the TCG API (https://dev.pokemontcg.io/dashboard).

The creation of Poke-Search is for several students in the Columbia University Full-Stack Bootcamp to grasp a clear understanding of collaboration while utilizing development skills obtained in the last three weeks.
